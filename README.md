## üìö Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and simulate a UI-core transformer with the following key specifications:
- **Primary Voltage**: 230V RMS
- **Core Type**: UI laminated core (Electrical-Steel-NGO-35PN250)
- **Core Magnetic Properties**: Characterized using BH curves fitted with MATLAB's Curve Fitting Toolbox.

## üìù Design & Simulation Procedure

### Core Selection & Magnetic Characterization
- Selected a UI-core with dimensions determined by the project requirements.
- The core‚Äôs BH curve was extracted from provided data and mathematically fitted using exponential functions in MATLAB.

### Simulink Model Development
- Built the transformer model in Simulink using **Simscape ‚Äì Foundation Library** and **Magnetics** components.
- Used an **Electromagnetic Converter (EC)** block to connect electrical and magnetic domains.
- Included nonlinear magnetic reluctance to represent the core‚Äôs behavior.

### Simulation Scenarios
- **Open-circuit and short-circuit tests** were conducted to determine equivalent circuit parameters.
- Various load resistances were simulated to observe:
  - Flux waveform 
  - Input and output voltages
  - Input and output currents
  - Effects of leakage inductance and core saturation.

### Data Analysis
- Compared simulation results with theoretical calculations.
- Verified that the transformer‚Äôs turn ratio and flux density matched design specifications.
- Analyzed reasons for any waveform distortions or deviations.

##  Key Considerations
- Both electrical sides were grounded for stable simulation.
- Proper solver configuration was set with a simulation time of at least 0.1s (5 cycles at 50Hz).
- Used **Simulink-PS Converter** and **PS-Simulink Converter** for interfacing physical and normal signals.
- Ensured correct MMF source polarity to prevent unstable behavior.
